A simple module to delete specific files.

It allows you to specify a list of files you want deleted on hosts in your infrastructure. When this module is deployed as part of your policy set, every time CFEngine runs, it will check if those files exist, and delete them if they do.

*Recommendation:* Enforce the removal of files known to be malicious or indicating insecure configuration.
Examples of such files are `~/.shosts` files, `/etc/cron.deny`, etc.

* Configuration

** Module input

This module accepts input.
Both the cfbs CLI and Mission Portal (3.21 and beyond) allow you to specify the files you want deleted.
Here is an example of what it looks like in Mission Portal:

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickanderson/cfengine-delete-files/main/delete-files-example-input-mp.png]]

** Variables
- =delete_files:delete_files.files= :: Array of dicts having =path= and =why= keys.

  - =path= must be a regular expression matching the fully qualified path to a file
  - =why=  should explain why the file being absent is important

               "path": "/root/.rhosts"
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     }
  #+end_src

  *Notes:*
  - Running with class =delete_files:DEBUG= or =default:DEBUG= define results in DEBUG reports from policy.
  - A list or array of files is also supported.
  - An array with filenames and dicts having =path=  and =why= keys is supported.
  - Absence of =why= key is supported.
  - A simple string is supported (but as indicated by DEBUG reports, likely a mis-configuration).
  - Directories are *not* deleted.

* History

- DEBUG reports added in version 2.0.0.
- Support for simple list specification added in version 2.0.0.
- Support for mixed data array specification added in version 2.0.0.
- Support for absence of =why= key added in version 2.0.0.
